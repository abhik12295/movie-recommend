## About
The objective behind a content-based (cognitive filtering) recommendation system is to suggest an item based on a comparison of the item's content and a user profile. In other words, I might be recommended a movie based on the descriptions of other movies.
There will be less variety in the recommendations in this situation, but it will work whether or not the user rates things.
