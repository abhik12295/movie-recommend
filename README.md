#Movie Recommendation System using Content Filtering
## About
The objective behind a content-based (cognitive filtering) recommendation system is to suggest an item based on a comparison of the item's content and a user profile. In other words, I might be recommended a movie based on the descriptions of other movies.
There will be less variety in the recommendations in this situation, but it will work whether or not the user rates things. If we compare this to the previous example, user B may enjoy dark comedy, but he or she will never know unless he or she decides to try it on their own, because this filter will only continue to propose dystopian films or similar.
